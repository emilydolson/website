          <p>My research interests are focused on the intersection of computer science, ecology, and evolutionary biology. 
            This involves doing <em>in silico</em> experiments to understand general properties of ecology and evolution, and using
            principles from biology to solve computational problems. Often these goals intersect. Many of my <em>in silico</em> 
            experiments are carried out on the <a href="http://avida.devosoft.org/">Avida Digital Evolution Platform</a>, an open 
            source research platform developed and maintained by the <a href="http://www.devolab.msu.edu">Devolab</a>. The primary 
            theme uniting my research is that I am fascinated by how evolution shapes and is shaped by ecological communities. 
            This often leads me to ask questions about how evolutionary processes generate and maintain diversity, particularly in the presence of spatial structure.</p>
          
          <p>Some specific projects that I&#8217;m currently working on include:</p>

            <br>
          </figure>
          <p>Maintaining population diversity is critical to successfully solving challenging problems with evolutionary computation.
            As a result, evolutionary computation researchers have come up with a variety of techniques for generating and maintaining diversity.
            All of these techniques create ecological interactions between members of the population. By understanding how these techniques map
            onto ecological scenarios in nature, we can import a vast number of results from evolutionary computation back into biology and vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preliminary work is presented <a href="pdfs/ecological-theory-insights.pdf">here</a>, and more in depth analysis is forthcoming (feel free to get in touch if you want more details now!).

            Many of the most effective techniques for generating and maintaining diversity in evolutionary computation involve creating niches associated with 
            different approaches to solving the problem. We can build on this technique by using niche creating as a tool for giving the algorithm "hints" about 
            how it might be effective to solve a problem. Most attempts to give hints to machine learning algorithms are unsuccessful because humans are often 
            very wrong about the best way to solve a problem. However, Eco-EA, an ecology-based evolutionary algorithm developed by 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jRXbZO4AAAAJ">Sherri Goings</a> and <a href="https://ofria.com">Charles Ofria</a>, has an amazing
            ability to ignore bad hints. We are <a href="pdfs/applying-ecological-principles.pdf">studying</a> the mechanisms behind this property and experimenting with using them to improve evolutionary computation.

            Are there systematic differences between evolution in digital systems and evolution in nature? If so, it's important to know about them, both so that we 
            can make sure insights from digital systems apply to natural systems in the way we expect, and so because the sources of such discrepancies are likely 
            highly informative when it comes to understanding drivers of evolution. Research on open-ended evolution seeks to address these questions. We have put 
            together a suite of metrics for understanding open-ended evolution, and are now in the process of applying them to various systems to see what we can learn. 
            We have <a href="pdfs/identifying-components-open.pdf">begun applying these metrics</a>  to simple evolving systems.

            In an effort to understand the short-term effects that add up to produce long-term evolutionary dynamics, we have been working on ways to summarize and quantify the behavior of individual lineages.
            This includes <a href=https://peerj.com/preprints/26883/>a suite of quantitative metrics</a>, and a three-dimensional visualization (<a href="pdfs/vr_fitness_landscape.pdf">described here</a>,

            How do spatially heterogenous environments impact the way populations traverse fitness landscapes? Do some regions of the environment guide the population into more evolvable areas of the fitness landscape?
            If so, we would expect to see that there are some regions of space where a new trait is more likely to first appear than we would expect by chance. Using Avida, I <a href="pdfs/evolutionary_hotspots.pdf">found</a> that such evolutionary hotspots
            do indeed occur. This work builds on my <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/12/148973">prior research</a> on the effect of spatial heterogeneity on eco-evolutionary dynamics.

          <p>
            When we place reserves for conservation purposes, we are determining the spatial structure of the population going forward, something which is known to have strong impacts on evolutionary dynamics.
            However, most conservation biology research does not study evolutionary effects, because of the broad temporal scale this would require. We are <a href="pdfs/evolution_reserve_placement.pdf">using Avida to explore</a> the interactions between 
            evolution and reserve placement decisions.
