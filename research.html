          <p>My research interests are focused on the intersection of computer science, ecology, and evolutionary biology. 
            This involves doing <em>in silico</em> experiments to understand general properties of ecology and evolution, and using
            principles from biology to solve computational problems. Often these goals intersect. Many of my <em>in silico</em> 
            experiments are carried out on the <a href="http://avida.devosoft.org/">Avida Digital Evolution Platform</a>, an open 
            source research platform developed and maintained by the <a href="http://www.devolab.msu.edu">Devolab</a>. The primary 
            theme uniting my research is that I am fascinated by how evolution shapes and is shaped by ecological communities. 
            This often leads me to ask questions about how evolutionary processes generate and maintain diversity, particularly in the presence of spatial structure.</p>
          
          <p>Some specific projects that I&#8217;m currently working on include:</p>
          <h2 id="EC_ecology">Ecological communities in evolutionary computation <a href=https://github.com/emilydolson/ecology_of_evolutionary_computation><img src="images/GitHub-Mark.png" style="height:30px;vertical-align:middle;"></a></h2>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/interaction_networks.png" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center"><em>Ecological interactions (blue is positive, red is negative) between members of a populaiton under various selection schemes from evolutionary computation.</em></figcaption>
            <br>
          </figure>
          <p>Maintaining population diversity is critical to successfully solving challenging problems with evolutionary computation.
            As a result, evolutionary computation researchers have come up with a variety of techniques for generating and maintaining diversity.
            All of these techniques create ecological interactions between members of the population. By understanding how these techniques map
            onto ecological scenarios in nature, we can import a vast number of results from evolutionary computation back into biology and vice versa.
          </p>

          <h2 id="eco_hints">Using ecology to provide hints to evolutionary computation<a href=https://github.com/emilydolson/eco-ea-box><img src="images/GitHub-Mark.png" style="height:30px;vertical-align:middle;"></a></h2>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/eco-ea-heatmaps.png" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center"><em>Eco-EA is able to solve an otherwise too-challenging problem when it is given an adequate number of good hints (regardless of the number of bad hints it is given).
              Lexicase, another algorithm that generates and maintains diversity by associating niches with different approaches to solving the problem, performs better when given perfect hints but is not resistant to bad hints.
            </em></figcaption>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Many of the most effective techniques for generating and maintaining diversity in evolutionary computation involve creating niches associated with 
            different approaches to solving the problem. We can build on this technique by using niche creating as a tool for giving the algorithm "hints" about 
            how it might be effective to solve a problem. Most attempts to give hints to machine learning algorithms are unsuccessful because humans are often 
            very wrong about the best way to solve a problem. However, Eco-EA, an ecology-based evolutionary algorithm developed by 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jRXbZO4AAAAJ">Sherri Goings</a> and <a href="https://ofria.com">Charles Ofria</a>, has an amazing
            ability to ignore bad hints. We are studying the mechanisms behind this property and experimenting with using them to improve evolutionary computation.

            Are there systematic differences between evolution in digital systems and evolution in nature? If so, it's important to know about them, both so that we 
            can make sure insights from digital systems apply to natural systems in the way we expect, and so because the sources of such discrepancies are likely 
            highly informative when it comes to understanding drivers of evolution. Research on open-ended evolution seeks to address these questions. We have put 
            together a suite of metrics for understanding open-ended evolution, and are now in the process of applying them to various systems to see what we can learn.
