              Advisor: <a href="http://ofria.com">Charles Ofria</a>
            </p></li>
            <li><p><b>Fink Fellow, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest</b> - Woodstock, NH <br>
                <i>Summer 2013</i><br>
                I developed an algorithm that categorized streaming, high-dimensional, multi-modal, high- resolution, time-series data and detecting errors and unusual events. I implemented it in Python, running on an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance, and found that it successfully identified errors and interesting events in data from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. This program is now running on all of Hubbard Brookâ€™s incoming data. I also assisted with a variety of field ecology research, including salamander, bird, and vegetation monitoring, nutrient manipulation, and routine sensor maintenance.
            </p></li>
            <li><p><b>Undergraduate Researcher, Swarthmore College Computer Science Department</b> - Swarthmore, PA <br>
                <i>Summer 2012</i><br>
                I attempted to improve ACMI, a program that predicts protein structure from x-ray crystallography and amino acid sequences, by incorporating the ability for it to use domain knowledge (the depth of an amino acid). This involved mining a database of thousands of proteins using python, matlab, and Bash shell scripts. I tested the efficacy of my modifications, using Condor to run many tests in parallel.
            </p></li>
            <li><p><b>Honors Thesis Student, Swarthmore College Biology Department </b> - Swarthmore, PA <br>
                <i>Summer 2011</i><br>
                I discovered a combination of non-chemical methods that may enable the control of invasive Japanese knotweed. I accomplished this by carrying out a 2-month greenhouse experiment and coding a model in C++ that synthesized my experimental findings with pre-existing research.

        See <a href="publications.html">Publications</a>.

        <h3>Presentations</h3>
        Because in computer science it is common to publish papers in peer-reviewed conferences, my presentations list overlaps heavily with my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> list. To avoid redundancy, I'm excluding talks that accompany a publication from this list.
